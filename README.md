An attempt to produce 3D Rendering in C++ from "scratch" (using only 2D tools), using SFML.
<br>
This is still very much WIP.
<br>
It can, for the time-being, visualize objects with faces, using mesh data. The source includes the mesh of a (light blue, with white edges, upon rendering) tetrahedron using coordinates generated by AI. However, the projection is still quite distorted.
<br>
I might upload a post on my website breaking this down, when the project is completed.

# Instructions
## Prerequisites
SFML (libsfml), g++

since I am developing this on my Linux install, I am completely oblivious to the method of running this on Windows, or Mac. It is (obviously) platform independent, however.  Run it if you know how to.

## Compilation/Running on Linux
To compile on Linux

``g++ main.cpp -o renderer -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system``

Run using

``./renderer``

Move using WASD. Rotate using Arrow keys. LShift and Spacebar for moving in/out.

# To-Do
Back-face culling, Painter's algorithm, etc. - Efficiency improvements all around. <br>
Minimizng distortion, if possible <br>
Support for .obj files, maybe other formats - basically, support for  any commonly used portable 3D format, <br>
Textures(?), maybe? Along with shading, lighting. <br>
Documentation/An article explaining the logic behind its operation.
