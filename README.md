An attempt to produce 3D Rendering in C++ from scratch using SFML.

This is still very much WIP.

It can, for the time-being, visualize 3D objects with faces using mesh data. The source includes the mesh of a (light blue, with white edges, upon rendering) tetrahedron using coordinates generated by AI. The model auto-rotates, once along each axis, before looping. 

I may upload a post on my website breaking this down when the project is completed. Incrementally updating the project using this repository thus serves an important purpose.

# Instructions
## Prerequisites
SFML (libsfml), g++

since I am developing this on my Linux install, I am completely oblivious to the method of running this on Windows, or Mac. It is (obviously) platform independent, however.Run it if you know how to.

## Compilation/Running on Linux
To compile on Linux

``g++ main.cpp -o renderer -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system``

Run using

``./renderer``

I have axed any controls, for now.

# To-Do
Minimizng distortion  <br>
Support for .obj files, maybe other formats - basically, support for  any commonly used portable 3D format, <br>
Textures(?), maybe? Along with shading, lighting. <br>
Documentation/An article explaining the logic behind its operation.
